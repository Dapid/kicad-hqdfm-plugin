# HQ DFM analysis


### Implementing One-Click PCB Design Flaw Analysis with HQ DFM in KiCad

The HQ DFM analysis plugin will assist you in:

- One-click analysis of over 20 design risk issues including open circuits, disconnected traces, line spacing, and width.
- Automatically analyzing PCB design flaws and eliminating production difficulties and design defects.

After checking the design flaws, you can use the NextPCB plugin to directly add them to your shopping cart at Huachuang.
